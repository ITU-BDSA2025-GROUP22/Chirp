## ðŸ“– About

Introductory project in C# and ASP.NET with fundamental software engineering practices!
In this project we will create a Twitter (X) clone, called "Chirp!"
The project will be developed iteratively and incrementally, to mimic a way of agile software development.
We will learn how to structure quality code and software for maintainability and good communication between developers
---
## ðŸš€ Languages and Frameworks
- Câ™¯/.NET/ASP.NET
- Bash shell scripts
- YAML based build workflows
- HTML
- We do that in Câ™¯/.NET mainly since this is an external requirement that ITU students should have experience with.
- Bash since it is ubiquitous in software development.
