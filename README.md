## ðŸ“– About
Introductory project in C# and ASP.NET with fundamental software engineering practices!
In this project we will create a Twitter (X) clone, called "Chirp!"
The project will be developed iteratively and incrementally, to mimic a way of agile software development.
We will learn how to structure quality code and software for maintainability and good communication between developers

## ðŸš€ Languages and Frameworks
- Câ™¯/.NET/ASP.NET

- Bash since it is ubiquitous in software development.
